This plugin enables individual author descriptions for each single blog in a multisite network.

== Description ==

When running [WordPress Multisites](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) to maintain various top level domains or a multilingual version of your site you might probably run into the problem of having the same author description / biography on each of them.

This is unfortunate not only on multilingual sites.

Long story short, this plugin enables you to enter the author biography for each user on a per-blog basis.

You donâ€™t have to do anything, but to install and activate the plugin and to enter the author bio into through the dashboard(s) of your site(s).

Please visit the github repository on https://github.com/webzunft/multisite-individual-author if you want to contribute, post a specific feature request or bug report.

**Some things site admins and developers might want to know:**

* the plugin only works when multisite support is enabled
* the biography is saved using a custom profile field for each blog with the pattern 'ima_description_BLOGID', e.g. _img_description_3_
* the filter get_the_author_description is used to load the "right" description; this is used by the`_author_meta()` and `get_the_author_meta()` functions


== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `individual-multisite-author` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the IMA through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

You will now see an additional field for the author description when you visit the author profile.
This field is individual for each blog, so make sure you first login to the right dashboard when changing the authors bio for a specific site in your multisite environment.
